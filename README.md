# Tessera
 BYUI Senior Project
### Overview
The Tessera Daily Planner is a simple personal task management software patterned after large project management software such as QlickUp and Jira, but tailored to individuals as opposed to teams. It was developed as my senior project over the course of a semester under the mentorship and direction of my professor and other faculty. Tessera was built as a Blazor Web Assembly App using ASP.NET Core. I utilized Entity Framework to perform database queries using a DBContext with DBSet properties to navigate tables and their relationships. I utilized IdentityUser to create and manage user authentication, coupled with JWT tokens.
